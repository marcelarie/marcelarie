My name is Marcel and I'm a 28 y/o software developer from Barcelona, Spain. My
journey as a programmer began over 3 years ago. I specialize in using React and
TypeScript for my Frontend projects, as well as Node.js, Rust, Python and Ruby
for backend and CLI programs.

## What I do:

- ðŸ¦¾ I'm currently working at [Worldsensing](https://github.com/StuartApp) as a
  Fullstack developer.
- ðŸŒ± I'm learning Rust and reinforcing my low level knowledge to create some
  really cool projects in the future.
- ðŸ’¯ I am an active collaborator in various open source projects, constantly
  seeking opportunities to contribute and improve.
