My name is Marcel and I'm a 27 y/o software developer from Barcelona, Spain.

My journey as a programmer started recently, so there are lots of things still
to learn. I work with React and TypeScript for my Frontend projects, and
Node.JS, Rust or Perl for the backend and CLI programs.

#### What I do:

-   ðŸ¦¾ I'm currently working at [Stuart](https://github.com/StuartApp) as a
    frontend developer.
-   ðŸŒ± I'm learning Rust and reinforcing my low level knowledge to create some
    really cool projects in the future :).
-   ðŸ’¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the Linux kernel and the Neovim text
    editor.
