My name is Marcel and I'm a 25 y/o software developer from Barcelona, Spain.   

My journey as a programmer started recently, so there are lots of things still to learn.
I work with React and TypeScript for my Frontend projects, and Node.JS,  Rust or Perl for the backend and CLI programs.

#### What I do:  
- ðŸ¦¾ I'm currently working at [Soy Super](https://github.com/soysuper) as a backend developer and systems admin.   
- ðŸŒ± I'm learning Rust and reinforcing my low level knowledge to create some really cool projects in the future :).
- ðŸ’¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the Linux kernel and the Neovim text editor, BIG fan of both.
